# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Feature Tasks Code Challenge Class 10
**Write the following methods for the Stack:**

- push
    - arguments: new value
    - adds a new node with the given value to the top of the stack
- pop
    - arguments: none
    - removes the topmost node and returns its value
- peek
    - arguments: none
    - checks what the top most node is, returns an exception if stack is empty
- isEmpty
    - arguments: None
    - Checks the top most node and returns a boolean depending if there is a stack or not

**Write the following methods for the Queue:**

- enqueue
    - arguments: new value
    - adds a new node with the given value to the front of the stack
- deqeueu
    - arguments: none
    - removes the front node of the queue and returns its value
- peek
    - arguments: none
    - checks what the front most node is, returns an exception if stack is empty
- isEmpty
    - arguments: None
    - Checks the front most node and returns a boolean depending if there is a queue or not

- [x] Can successfully pop off the stack
- [x] Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
- [x] Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
- [x] Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
- [x] Can successfully enqueue into a queue
- [x] Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
- [x] Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
- [x] Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
- [x] Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
- [x] Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
