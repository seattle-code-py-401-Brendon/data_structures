### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Time Complexity: Not sure but it only has to go through the list or BST once so I would assume O(1)
Space Complexity: O(N)

### Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- Runs through the list of BST and updates the current max value

### Tests
<!-- test names and what they test for -->
No tests per roger
